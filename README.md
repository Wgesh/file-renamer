# file-renamer
This is a Python script that converts other files in the working directory from snake case (example_file.txt) to regular naming (Example File.txt). You should be able to copy the script into any folder and run it to rename all the files there.

The script that runs this and other folders in the directory are not renamed (folder renaming may be added later).
